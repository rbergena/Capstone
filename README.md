# JamOut
JamOut is my individual capstone project for [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/) (cohort 8).
JamOut is a react native app that helps musicians find other local musicians with similar interests. 

# About
JamOut aims to help connect musicians who are looking for other musicians to play music with. Using JamOut, a musician can create a profile with a picture, a description with information about themselves and what they are looking for, links to music accounts like SoundCloud, a selection of instruments they play, and the genres of music they perform. The musician can then navigate to a list view or map view of musicians near them. They can filter and search for musicians based on profiles with instruments and genres they are interested in. Once the musician finds a person they are interested in playing music with, they can choose to chat with this other user. The other musician will then receive this message in real time and the two can talk about what they are looking for and hopefully meet and make music!

Watch a [demo](https://youtu.be/mPyGGgCVrjM) of two musicians using the app.
